\title{The Problem of the Randomly Walked Dog}
\author{Scallop Ye}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
    In 1905, Karl Pearson \cite{pearson} proposed on \emph{Nature} the
    famous problem of the random walk. In this article, we present a new
    combinatorial optimization problem in the spirit of Pearson's one,
    along with some preliminary results based on computer simulation.

\section{Introduction}

A man walks the dog every day. The dog will prepare $n$ cards beforehand ($n\ge3$),
each containing a direction and a distance.
They start from home and repeat the following process $n$ times:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item choose a card randomly;
    \item turn to the direction given on the card;
    \item walk the distance given on the card in a straight line;
    \item throw the card away.
\end{enumerate}

After these $n$ rounds, they shall be exactly back home. The dog wins a treat
if they \emph{never} visited any place more than once except their home.

Now, the dog asks for your help in maximizing the probability of winning the
treat in a walk. Note that too much calculation exhausts the dog.

\begin{remark}
    As one might have seen, this problem differs from Pearsonâ€™s one in that
    it is not inherently probabilistic. We will be using permutations
    instead to formally define the problem in the next section.
\end{remark}

\section{Definitions}

Let us take a look at the cards first. The cards the dog prepares should represent
a sequence of nonzero vectors that sum to zero in $\mathbb{R}^2$, or in $\mathbb{Z}^2$
without loss of generality. We may then define

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{step vector} is a nonzero vector in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
    An \emph{$n$-step sequence} $S$, or generally a \emph{step sequence},
    is a finite sequence $(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)$ of step vectors;
    we say that $S$ is \emph{zero-sum} iff $\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i=(0,0)$.
\end{definition}

Then in order to study the points the pair visits in a walk, we shall introduce
polygonal paths:

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{polygonal path} $P$ is a finite sequence $(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_n)$
    of points called its \emph{vertices}; the line segments
    $\overline{p_0p_1},\overline{p_1p_2},\dots,\overline{p_{n-1}p_n}$
    are called its \emph{edges}.
\end{definition}

The winning conditions for the dog naturally translate to whether the polygonal
path formed in a walk does not ``intersect itself'', or in other words whether
the path is simple.

\begin{definition}
    A polygonal path $(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_n)$ is \emph{simple}
    iff for all $0<i\le j<n$,
    \[
        \overline{p_{i-1}p_i}\cap\overline{p_jp_{j+1}}=
        \begin{cases}
            \{p_i\}            & \text{if $i=j$},                     \\
            \{p_0\}\cap\{p_n\} & \text{if $n\ge3$ and $(i,j)=(1,n-1)$}, \\
            \varnothing        & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \]
\end{definition}

Geometrically, a simple path is one in which only consecutive
edges intersect and only at their endpoints; it may also
be \emph{closed} as specially dealt with in the second case above.
Then, we define a way to create a path from a step sequence:

\begin{definition}
    Let $S=(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)$ be a step sequence. The \emph{walk} of $S$
    is the polygonal path $(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_n)$
    where $p_0=(0,0)$ and $p_i=p_{i-1}+s_i$ for all $1\le i\le n$.
\end{definition}

Finally, we define the value we are maximizing and then the problem:

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{simplicity} of a step sequence $S$
    is the number of permutations $S'$ of $S$
    such that the walk of $S'$ is simple.
\end{definition}

\section{Preliminary Results}

Let us fix $n\ge3$. We first present a proposition which
implies that it is always possible for the dog to win.


\begin{proposition}
    Let $S$ be a zero-sum $n$-step sequence. If the step vectors in $S$ are not all collinear,
    then there exists a permutation $S'$ of $S$ such that the walk of $S'$ is simple.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \emph{Warning: This is only a sketch of the proof with nontrivial gaps.}

    Let $S'=(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)$ be a permutation of $S$ such that, with
    $s_i=\langle r_i,\angle\theta_i\rangle$ and $-\pi<\theta_i\le\pi$ for all $1\le i\le n$,
    the sequence $(\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_n)$ is increasing.
    Let $P$ be the walk of $S'$. Since $S$ is zero-sum, $S'$ is also zero-sum and thus $P$
    is a polygon. One can show that every interior angle of $P$ is less than
    or equal to $\pi$, and so $P$ is convex.
    A convex polygon whose edges are not all collinear is simple.
\end{proof}

By computer simulation on Problem \ref{problem:rwd}, we observe that the maximum
simplicity on record follows a very simple formula, hence the following conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}
    The maximum simplicity of a zero-sum $n$-step sequence
    is exactly $2\cdot n!/(n-1)$.
\end{conjecture}

A promising start indeed. This makes me think that a simple solution ought to be found,
if only in a form that I can at all understand.
